    <p>Hello! This website is here to teach you the basics of HTML and CSS. 
        There are many programming languages out there, but these are the 
        two most suitable for creating web pages. HTML stands for Hypertext 
        Markup Language, and it can do many things. You can use HTML to make 
        headings, paragraphs, tables, buttons, pictures, and many more. 
        Basically, if you were to look at a web page and take away all the 
        decorations like alignment, spacing, font, color, et cetera, you would 
        be left with the HTML. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and this 
        is what creates the decorations, it's what makes a website look good. 
        Like I said earlier, it's the alignment, spacing, font, colors, size, 
        borders, and more.</p>
    
    <h1 id="getting-started" class="primary-header">Getting started</h1>
    <p>When wanting to program a website, you might find yourself asking, 
        where do I go to write my code? When using any programming language, 
        you must type it in a text editor. A text editor is exactly what it sounds
        like, it's a place where you can edit text and save it as a file on your 
        computer. Some common examples are Microsoft Word or your computer's Notepad. 
        These editors are preliminary, they don't really do anything to help you, 
        that's why I recommend using an editor like Sublime Text Editor, Visual Studio
        Code, or Notepad++. What makes these editors so good is that they are free,
        and they color code. By this, I mean that instead of all your code being in 
        black and white, once the editor knows what language you are writing in, it
        will automatically color code everything so that it is easy to distinguish. 
        Also, when typing a command, it will show you options that you can click to 
        have it finish for you, it works just like the suggestions bar on your phone 
        keyboard. In order to activate these features when coding a website, save the 
        document as a (insert name here).html file. Saving the document this way is 
        also how you save it in order to see what you have been working on. Once you 
        save it as a .html file you open it usually with Chrome but you can with pretty 
        much any browser.</p>


    <h1 id="starting-page" class="primary-header">Starting the HTML page</h1>
    <p class="info">Once you have opened up the page and saved it as a .html file the first theing that 
        you will put is &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; - used to tell the computer that you are coding in the newest version of HTML and it is self closing meaning it has no end tag </li>
        </ul>
    <p class="info">After that you should put the html tag</p>
    <ul>
    
        <li>&lt;html&gt; -  this is used to define that it is an html document and this will always be the first and last tag in your docutment</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">The first thing inside the html tag is &lt;head&gt;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;head&gt; - this is where you will put information about the document</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">One piece of info will be the title(goes inside the head)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;title&gt; -  what you put in here is what will be shown in the browser's title bar or a page's tab.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info"> Another piece of information that goes in the head is the meta tag</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt; - this lets the browser know what charachter set you are using </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">The last part of the set up is the body</p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;body&gt; - this is out side of the head and it is Where the rest of your html goes, most of your code will be in here </li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
    <p class="info">Images </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lt;img src="" alt="" width=""&gt; - src is where you will put the image link(to do this find an image online, right click it and click copy image adress), alt is the alternate text that will show if the image cant load, and width is the width dimensions and it is self closing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="info">List </p>

        <p class="descripiton">Once you have selected what you want to change, inside 
            the curly brackets is where you will put how you change it. When using 
            color you will use a system called rgb(Red, Green, Blue). There are three 
            values that are inside rgb parentheses that go from 0 ot 255, the lower the
            number the darker the color and the higher the number the brighter the color</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>color: rgb(255, 0, 0);</strong> - colors the text(these values make a bright red)</li>
            <li><strong>background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);</strong> - colors the background of the selected element</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="font-style" class="primary-header">Font-Styling</h1>
        <p class="descripition">When looking at fonts there are 3 different kind
             serif, sans-serif, and monospace. Sans fonts have an extra stroke 
             or decorative design on the end of letters on famous example is Times 
             New Roman, another is the Georgia font. Sans-serif has no extra stroke
             or design, one famous example of this one is Arial and Helvetica. 
             Monospace means that each letter, number and symbol take up the same 
             amount of space the default font looks like a typewriter.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>font-size: 16px;</strong> - font size is measured in pixels(16px is the default size of paragraps if you dont change it)</li>
            <li><strong>font-family:"Arial", sans-serif;</strong> - the reason that I put sans-serif is for backup. Just incase the browser doesn't support that font I figured out which of the 3 categories that my font falls under and put that because the browser will choose another sans-serif font</li>
            <li><strong>text-decoration-line: underline;</strong> - underlines text, could have also been overlineo r line-through. If you don't wan't a link to have an underline you can set it to none</li>
            <li><strong>font-style: italics;</strong> - another way to slant text, also could have been oblique or normal(no slant)</li>
            <li><strong>line-height: 15px;</strong> - line spacing</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="positioning" class="primary-header">Alignment/Positioning</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>text-alignment: center;</strong> - this alings text 3 ways, left, right, and center</li>
            <li><strong>margin: 20px;</strong> - increases margin, if you wan't to increase only one side add a dash(-)then bottom, top, left or right. If you but auto the browser will automaticly center the element(will not center text)</li>
            <li><strong>padding: 20px;</strong> - increases padding, if you wan't to increase only one side add a dash(-)then bottom, top, left or right</li>
            <li><strong>width: 40px or 80%;</strong> - width can be measured in pixels or in percent. Percent use that amout of space up. For example the white background of this page has a width of 70%</li>
